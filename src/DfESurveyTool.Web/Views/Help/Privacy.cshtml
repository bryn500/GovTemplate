<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What data we need</h2>

<p>
    The personal data we collect from you includes:

    <li>information on how you use the site, using <a href="/info/cookies">cookies</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why we need it</h2>
<p>
    We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use the website. We do this to help make sure
    the site is meeting the needs of its users and to help us make future improvements.
</p>

<p>
    Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic.
    Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services.
</p>

<p>Google Analytics stores information about:</p>

<ul class="bullet-list">
    <li>the pages you visit on the website</li>
    <li>how long you spend on each page</li>
    <li>how you got to the site</li>
    <li>what you click on while you’re visiting the site</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy web page</a>.
</p>

<p>We do not collect or store your personal information (for example your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we do with your data</h2>

<p>The data we collect may be shared with supplier organisations, other government departments, agencies and public bodies.</p>

<p>We will not:</p>

<ul>
    <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
    <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We will share your data if we are required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we keep your data</h2>

<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>it is needed for the purposes set out in this document</li>
    <li>the law requires us to</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In general, this means that we will only hold your personal data for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 7 years.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where your data is processed and stored</h2>

<p>
    We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.
</p>

<p>
    Your personal data may, throughout the course of its processing, be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). Where this is the case,
    all appropriate technical and legal safeguards will be put in place to ensure that you are afforded the same level of protection as within the EEA.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we protect your data and keep it secure</h2>

<p>
    We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or
    disclosure of your data – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.
</p>

<p>
    We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your rights</h2>
<p>
    You have the right to request:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>information about how your personal data is processed</li>
    <li>a copy of that personal data</li>
    <li>that anything inaccurate in your personal data is corrected immediately</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also:</p>

<ul>
    <li>raise an objection about how your personal data is processed</li>
    <li>request that your personal data is erased if there is no longer a justification for it</li>
    <li>ask that the processing of your personal data is restricted in certain circumstances</li>
</ul>

    If you have any of these requests, get in contact with our Data Protection Officer.
